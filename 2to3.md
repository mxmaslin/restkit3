# notes about the port to python 3


This document is an attempt to summarize the actiosn needed to port
restkit to python 3.2 & sup.


## About strings

Like WSGI, restkit defines two kinds of "string":

- "Native" strings (which are always implemented using the type named
  str) that are used for request/response headers and metadata
- "Bytestrings" (which are implemented using the bytes type in Python 3,
  and str elsewhere), that are used for the bodies of requests and
responses (e.g. POST/PUT input data and HTML page outputs).

> Note: the content of native strings must still be translatable to
> bytes via the Latin-1 encoding

In short: where you see the word "string" in this document, it refers to
a "native" string, i.e., an object of type str, whether it is internally
implemented as bytes or unicode. Where you see references to
"bytestring", this should be read as "an object of type bytes under
Python 3, or type str under Python 2".


## Request 

- Headers are a list of `(key, value)` tuples or a dictionnary and
  their variables are represented as strings
- Any body should be represented as a bytestring, yelded bytestring or a
  binary file


## Response

- The response shoudl return the body as bytes or iterable The
  response
- headers are a list of `(key, value)` tuples or a dictionnary and their
  variables are represented as strings
- The status code is returned as an integer


## Implementations details

- all function wrapping or rewriting for python 3 should happen in
  py3compat
- The socket interface is only accepting bytes ...
